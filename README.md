# [ECEN 3360] Digital Design Lab

Coursework for University of Colorado Boulder's ECEN 3360, Spring 2020.
Good, low energy embedded practices done using a Silicon Labs devkit.

## Getting Started

These projects all rely on the following from Silicon Labs:
* Pearl Gecko 12 (devkit)
* Simplicity Studio (v4, devenv)

### Installing

Install [Simplicity Studio](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/simplicity-studio "silabs sstudio")

TODO: install needed tools for PG12 and Programmer

## Importing / Running Projects

I have included .zip exports of the projects with each release.
I recommend downloaded these archives, and importing them into Simplicity, like so:
File -> Import -> Existing Project into Workspace -> Archive File

### Versioning

These are indexed with version numbers:
* v1.x indicates Lab 1
* v2.x indicates Lab 2
Normally, x = 0, but occasionally corrections were made after labs were submitted, in which case x > 0.

## Lab Breakdowns

### Lab 1 - Blinky
